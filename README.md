# vondark

A dark Vim color scheme based on Google's [Material Design](https://material.io) palette. This theme requires [True Color (24-bit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_%2824-bit%29) support, so use either gVim or a [compatible terminal](https://github.com/termstandard/colors) with [`termguicolors`](https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27termguicolors%27) enabled.

Featuring:
* higher contrast and color saturation for a crisper look.
* a simple palette of 14 colors (6 shades of grey, 8 accent colors).
* colors focused around the syntax, greys focused around the UI elements.
* distinct highlighting for different kinds of constants.
* subtle fold highlighting to get text out of your way.
* uncomplicated source that isn't overwrought with configuration flags or code.
